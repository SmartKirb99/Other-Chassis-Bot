Strangely, The robot doesn't seem to move at all in auton anymore, it can turn, but it cannot move forward in auton anymore...
Also throwing "Internal issues with print and error tags"... A lot of them, perhaps that happens when the computer disconnects from the robot?
Now the issue seems to occur every time I try to enable the program. Way too many "Internal issues with print and error tags"...

This seems to happen a lot.

There only seems to be 3 motor controllers active, according to Tuner X.
Seemingly there is a new error replacing the Internal issues with print and error tags.

More errors all causing the robot to reset, perhaps it has something to do with electrical. As the router on the robot seems to reset when I go too fast.
Going too fast and stopping abruptly seems to cause the router to reset, and perhaps the same thing is happening with the rio.
And as it turns out that wasn't the case, I drove it a little and the router reset.


So apparently, Scanner and Random do not work on the Robot at all.
